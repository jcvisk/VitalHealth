                            VITAL HEALTH (“VITAL HEALTH”) is a direct sales company dedicated to providing quality
                            products and services promoted through your home-based business. We pride ourselves on our
                            integrity in dealing with our independent distributors and customers will continue to do so.
                            We provide a compensation plan based on sales of our products to end-users and those of you
                            who wish to help us promote and sell our products can be rewarded under that plan. VITAL
                            HEALTH does not require, nor do we tolerate “inventory loading” and you will never be forced
                            to make large purchases. All distributors, or Affiliates (AFFILIATEs) as we refer to them,
                            must agree to conduct themselves with the utmost honesty and integrity in the promotion of
                            their independent VITAL HEALTH distributorship. This includes abiding by the terms and
                            conditions of the AFFILIATE Agreement, the Policies and Procedures listed below and
                            fulfilling the requirements and qualifications of the Compensation Plan as they exist now
                            and as they may be amended from time to time.

                            <strong>1 Introduction</strong> <br>
                            <strong id="1.1">1.1 Purpose</strong><br>
                            VITAL HEALTH has developed these Policies and
                            Procedures, which may sometimes be referred to as the AFFILIATE Manual, to guide its
                            Affiliates (AFFILIATE) in the successful promotion of VITAL HEALTH products and services.
                            These Policies and Procedures will help provide the following benefits:
                            <br><br>
                            1) Protect the rights of all Affiliates by providing a guidelines and a framework within
                            which each Affiliate may work in an ethical, effective and secure manner.
                            <br><br>
                            2) Provide an equal and level playing field of opportunity to all VITAL HEALTH Affiliates.
                            All AFFILIATEs will be treated fairly, reasonably and professionally.
                            <br><br>
                            3) Clearly define the relationship between VITAL HEALTH and its Affiliates.
                            <br><br>
                            4) Inform Affiliates regarding compliance issues and regulatory requirements. VITAL HEALTH
                            requires that all Affiliates understand and abide by these Policies and Procedures as we
                            work together in promoting the VITAL HEALTH products and opportunity. Of course if any
                            AFFILIATE has any questions with respect to Policies and Procedures, you may contact VITAL
                            HEALTH for clarification. VITAL HEALTH will apply these Policies and Procedures fairly and
                            equitably to all AFFILIATEs but understands that there may be certain cases or circumstances
                            that require special handling or consideration. Any exceptions or extenuating circumstances
                            that may apply will be determined by VITAL HEALTH at its sole discretion and will not
                            automatically apply in any other situation or matter unless the applicable policy or
                            procedure is officially modified or amended.
                        </p>

                            Regardless of the specific policies and procedures stated within, all AFFILIATEs will
                            conduct themselves honestly, ethically, morally and professionally with respect to their
                            VITAL HEALTH business and all promotion and sales activity. No AFFILIATE may take any action
                            with respect to VITAL HEALTH or that affects VITAL HEALTH in any way other than in the
                            fulfillment of their AFFILIATE Agreement. No conduct that negatively impacts VITAL HEALTH
                            will be permitted. VITAL HEALTH will not tolerate high-pressure sales tactics or the use of
                            any misleading, confusing, false or exaggerated statements or claims with respect to VITAL
                            HEALTH or VITAL HEALTH products and services.

                            sole discretion of VITAL HEALTH (“VITAL HEALTH®” or the “Company” or “VITAL HEALTH”), are
                            incorporated into, and form an integral part of, the VITAL HEALTH Affiliate Agreement.
                            Throughout these Policies and Procedures, when the term “Agreement” is used, it collectively
                            refers to the VITAL HEALTH Affiliate Agreement and its Terms and Conditions, these Policies
                            and Procedures and the VITAL HEALTH Compensation Plan. These documents are incorporated by
                            reference into the VITAL HEALTH Affiliate Agreement. It is the responsibility of each
                            Affiliate to read, understand, adhere to and ensure that he or she is aware of and operating
                            under the most current version of these Policies and Procedures. When enrolling a new
                            Affiliate, it is the responsibility of the Enroller (as further defined below) to provide
                            the most current version of these Policies and Procedures and the VITAL HEALTH Compensation
                            Plan (which can be done by directing the applicant to the website) to the applicant prior to
                            his or her execution of the Affiliate Agreement.

                            In order to ensure that VITAL HEALTH is always in compliance with applicable federal, state
                            and/or local laws, as well as being able to adapt to changing or evolving business
                            environments and markets, VITAL HEALTH reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend,
                            revise or change the AFFILIATE Agreement (including, without limitation, the Affiliate
                            Agreement, Terms and Conditions, Policies and Procedures and the Compensation Plan) and its
                            prices and product offering. VITAL HEALTH will notify AFFILIATEs by posting any amendments,
                            revisions or changes on the VITAL HEALTH corporate website. The most current and controlling
                            version will always be posted on www.VITAL HEALTHGLOBAL.com or other applicable website as
                            noticed. It is the responsibility of all AFFILIATEs to regularly review the company website
                            as well as stay current on all notices given through the various communications between
                            VITAL HEALTH and AFFILIATEs. An AFFILIATE’s continued use of any VITAL HEALTH- related

                            of any compensation under the Compensation Plan will indicate acceptance of any published

                            revisions or changes must resign and will not be able to conduct any VITAL HEALTH business.

                            Agreement and/or these Policies and Procedures at any time. No failure of VITAL HEALTH to

                            AFFILIATE with any obligation or provision of the Agreement, and no custom or practice of

                            HEALTH’s right to demand exact compliance with the Agreement. Waiver by VITAL HEALTH can be
                            affected only in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. VITAL HEALTH waiver of any
                            particular breach by an Affiliate shall not affect or impair VITAL HEALTH rights with
                            respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations

                            right arising from a breach affect or impair VITAL HEALTH rights as to that or any
                            subsequent breach. The allegation or existence of any claim or cause of action of an

                            distributorship. A husband and wife are only permitted to have one distributorship between
                            them unless they follow the procedure for a husband and wife to have separate
                            distributorships as explained in these Policies and Procedures. A validly formed business
                            entity may become an AFFILIATE, provided it can submit valid documentation as may be
                            requested by VITAL HEALTH. An individual may not participate in multiple distributorships
                            through the use of business entities. No “ghost” distributorships (false distributorships
                            set up to maintain a position in the genealogy) are permitted.

                            to entice another AFFILIATE to become part of a different AFFILIATEs Marketing Organization.
                            If Cross Sponsoring is discovered, it must be brought to VITAL HEALTH’s attention
                            immediately. VITAL HEALTH may take action against the AFFILIATE who changed organizations
                            and/or those AFFILIATEs who encouraged or participated in the Cross-Sponsoring. VITAL HEALTH
                            may also move all or part of the offending AFFILIATE’s downline to his or her original
                            Downline organization if the Company deems it equitable and feasible to do so. However,
                            VITAL HEALTH is under no obligation to move the Cross-Sponsored Affiliate’s downline
                            organization, and the ultimate disposition of the organization remains within the sole
                            discretion of VITAL HEALTH. AFFILIATEs waive any and all claims and causes of action against
                            VITAL HEALTH arising from or relating to the disposition of the Cross-Sponsored Affiliate’s
                            downline organization.

                            HEALTH’s determination. Upon compliance with all applicable requirements, a full refund,
                            less a 10% restocking fee and shipping and handling costs will be issued by the Company. Any
                            product that cannot be sold or is opened, used, damaged, expired, or within three (3) months
                            of expiration, will not be eligible for a refund. Please allow for up to twenty (20) days

                            (“RMA”) number and properly identify the product being returned. The obtaining of an RMA
                            does not mean that the product falls within the repurchase policy. That determination can
                            only be made after product is received by VITAL HEALTH. VITAL HEALTH is not under any
                            obligation to accept any returns not properly identified with an RMA number. Further, VITAL
                            HEALTH is under no obligation to return any products received that do not fall under the
